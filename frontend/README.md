# Le Gnome — casino frontend

Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite frontend for the Discord Activity casino "La Taverne Dorée". Renders character creation and the multiplayer casino games inside Discord's embedded app surface.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.17.0+
- The [backend](../backend/README.md) running on port 3001
- A Discord application configured for Activities
- mkcert (local HTTPS)

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### HTTPS setup (required for Discord Activity)

```bash
# install mkcert, e.g.
winget install FiloSottile.mkcert   # Windows
brew install mkcert                 # macOS

mkcert -install

mkdir certs && cd certs
mkcert -key-file localhost-key.pem -cert-file localhost.pem localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

`vite.config.ts` picks up `certs/localhost.pem` and `certs/localhost-key.pem` automatically if present; otherwise it falls back to plain HTTP.

### Environment configuration

Create `.env` in `frontend/`:

```env
VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=discord_client_id
# Optional backend origin for the WebSocket; defaults to the page origin
# (the Vite dev server proxies /api and /socket.io to localhost:3001)
# VITE_WS_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### Discord Developer Portal setup

1. Open the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and select your application.
2. Enable **Activities**.
3. Set the **Activity URL Override** to `https://localhost:3000/`.

### Development

```bash
npm run dev          # dev server on https://localhost:3000
npm run build         # production build (no type check)
npm run type-check    # vue-tsc, checks .vue and .ts files
npm run preview
npm run lint
npm test               # Vitest
npm run test:watch
npm run test:coverage
```

To test inside Discord: start the backend, start the frontend, join a voice channel, then launch the Activity from the Activities menu — the app loads with Discord OAuth handling authentication.

Opening `https://localhost:3000` directly in a browser (outside Discord) falls back to a mock Discord SDK plus `apiService.devLogin`, so the character-creation and casino flows can be exercised without going through Discord.

## Architecture

### Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Vue 3 (Composition API, `<script setup>`) | UI framework |
| TypeScript | Type-safe development |
| Vite | Build tool and dev server |
| PrimeVue 4 (Aura theme) | Component library |
| Tailwind CSS 4 | Utility styling |
| `@discord/embedded-app-sdk` | Discord Activity authentication and voice-participant info |
| Socket.io-client | Real-time WebSocket connection to the backend |
| Axios | REST client |
| Vitest + `@vue/test-utils` | Testing |

There is no router (view switching is a local `ref` in `App.vue`) and no global state library (Pinia/Vuex) — shared reactive state lives in composables (`useDiscordSdk`, `useEnergy`).

### Services

- **`api.ts`** — Axios client (base URL `/api`) with a bearer-token interceptor. Exposes `devLogin`, `getCurrentUser`, character CRUD, table creation, `spinSlots`, `rollDice`, `getEnergy`, and game history.
- **`websocket.ts`** — Socket.io-client wrapper exposing `connect`/`disconnect`/`on`/`off`/`emit` plus typed helpers for joining tables, betting, hitting/standing, and triggering the Bard's Lucky Song ability.
- **`discordSdk.ts`** — wraps `@discord/embedded-app-sdk`: initialization, current user/channel/guild, voice participants, activity state. Falls back to a mock SDK when not running inside Discord, for local development.

## Features

### Character creation

Six RPG classes (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Merchant, Bard, Paladin), defined in `src/constants/index.ts`. Selecting a class shows its casino bonus and special ability before confirming creation via `apiService.createCharacter`.

### Casino games

- **Blackjack** — multiplayer table (2–6 players), dealer section, hit/stand/double controls, synchronized via WebSocket
- **Roulette** — European wheel (0–36), interactive betting grid, synchronized betting timer
- **Slots** — themed reels with progressive jackpot
- **Dice** — two-dice roll with prediction-based multipliers

All four games connect to the backend's REST API for solo actions and Socket.io for multiplayer table state.

## Testing

13 Vitest test files under `src/__tests__/`, using `@vue/test-utils` and jsdom: the service layer (`api`, `cardUtils`, `discordSdk`, `websocket`), the composables (`useEnergy`, `useDiscordSdk`), and the logic-heavy components under `components/` (`App`, `CharacterCreation`, `CasinoLobby`, and the four casino games). See [docs/TESTING.md](../docs/TESTING.md) for the full breakdown and known gaps.

## Deployment

The frontend deploys to **o2switch (cPanel)** as plain static files on its own subdomain (e.g. `casino.example.com`), next to the [backend](../backend/README.md#deployment) on `api.example.com`. In production the app runs **inside Discord** — traffic flows through Discord's Activity proxy (`<app-id>.discordsays.com`), not directly to your domains.

### Automated deployment

GitHub Actions builds and uploads the frontend, with the same pipeline as the backend (and the portfolio) — see the [backend deployment notes](../backend/README.md#automated-deployment) for how it works and the full list of secrets.

- [`frontend-build.yml`](../.github/workflows/frontend-build.yml) runs `npm ci`, lint, `npm run type-check`, `npm test` and `npm run build` (Node 24). It runs on PRs touching `frontend/**`, and is called by the deploy.
- [`frontend-deploy.yml`](../.github/workflows/frontend-deploy.yml) runs on every push to `main` touching `frontend/**` or `.github/workflows/frontend-*.yml`, or manually (Actions → Deploy Frontend → Run workflow). It whitelists the runner's IP in cPanel and rsyncs `dist/` into `FRONTEND_REMOTE_PATH` with `--delete`, keeping `.well-known` (AutoSSL challenges), `cgi-bin`, `.env`, `.htpasswd` and `error_log`. Before syncing, it resolves `FRONTEND_REMOTE_PATH` on the server (`pwd -P`, so `.`, `..`, doubled slashes and symlinks are all resolved) and refuses unless it is an existing directory strictly below the account's home. rsync then targets that resolved path, because `--delete` into the home directory would wipe everything else hosted there.

Vite bakes `VITE_*` variables into the bundle at build time, so they come from **repository variables** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables), not from the server:

| Variable | |
|---|---|
| `VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` | required — the production Discord application ID. The deploy fails early if it's missing, rather than shipping a bundle that can't authenticate. |
| `VITE_WS_URL` | optional — explicit backend origin for the WebSocket. When unset, the socket targets the page origin, which resolves through the Discord proxy's `/socket.io` URL mapping (see below). |

Secrets needed: `CPANEL_USERNAME`, `CPANEL_SERVER`, `CPANEL_API_TOKEN`, `SSH_KEY` and `FRONTEND_REMOTE_PATH` (the subdomain's document root, e.g. `/home/<user>/casino.example.com`).

In cPanel, create the subdomain and enable AutoSSL for it — HTTPS is mandatory for Activities. The app has no client-side router, so no `.htaccess` rewrite rules are needed.

### Manual build and upload

If GitHub Actions is unavailable, build locally with production values (a `.env.production` file is picked up automatically by `npm run build`):

```env
# .env.production
VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_production_app_id
# VITE_WS_URL=https://api.example.com
```

```bash
npm run build   # outputs dist/
```

Then copy the *contents* of `dist/` to the subdomain's document root (cPanel File Manager, SFTP, or `rsync` over SSH).

### Discord Developer Portal — URL mappings

In your application's **Activities → URL Mappings**, map the proxy paths to your domains:

| Prefix | Target |
|---|---|
| `/` | `casino.example.com` |
| `/api` | `api.example.com/api` |
| `/socket.io` | `api.example.com/socket.io` |

The REST client uses relative `/api` URLs and the socket defaults to the page origin, so inside the Activity both resolve through these mappings. Then set the Activity URL mapping as the production entry point (replacing the `https://localhost:3000/` override used in development).

Two things to verify on the first production run, from inside Discord with the browser console open:

- Recent SDK versions route proxied requests under a `/.proxy/` path prefix. If `/api` requests 404 inside the Activity, pass the mappings to `patchUrlMappings` in `src/services/discordSdk.ts` (currently called with an empty array) so fetch/WebSocket URLs are rewritten to the proxy form automatically.
- If the Socket.io connection is refused, see the [backend note on WebSockets behind Passenger](../backend/README.md#socketio-behind-passenger).

Note: outside Discord (plain browser), the deployed frontend can't reach the backend — `/api` is relative to the frontend origin and shared hosting can't proxy it cross-domain. The in-browser demo mode is a development convenience only.

### Updating

Merging to `main` deploys automatically. If the URL mappings changed, re-check the Developer Portal configuration — that part isn't automated.

## Troubleshooting

**Discord Activity won't load** — check the HTTPS certs are valid, the backend is running on port 3001, and the Activity URL in the Discord Developer Portal matches.

**WebSocket connection fails** — verify `VITE_WS_URL` matches the backend and check the browser console for connection errors.

**Character creation errors** — check the backend `/api/characters/create` endpoint and MongoDB connectivity.
